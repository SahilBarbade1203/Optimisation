Gradient and Hessian Computation Assignment

Introduction

The goal of this assignment is to understand and implement gradient and hessian computation in Python. A scalar function f is defined as f : R^n â†’ R and the gradient of the function g and the hessian h are calculated using the central difference scheme.

Requirements

This assignment requires only the NumPy library.

Functions

The following functions are necessary to achieve the aim of this assignment:

func: This function contains the input function of two variables.
compute_hessian: This function evaluates the approximate hessian of the input function at a point x* using the central difference method.
compute_gradient: This function evaluates the approximate derivative of the input function at a point x* using the central difference method.
Usage

Using the above functions, the gradient and hessian matrix can be obtained as follows:

delF = compute_gradient(func, x_input)
del2F = compute_hessian(func, x_input)
